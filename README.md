Welcome to MeteoPoo! <br>
Here you will follow my evolution on the "Object-oriented PHP" language.
First, the notion of "class" then instantiation.
Each class includes a list of specified properties of their "modifier" depending on the level of protection desired.
In addition to properties, we list behaviors through methods: functions internal to the class.
Next, a constructor.
This is followed by securing with accessors and mutators: we use the "set" functions to program, and the "get" function to return.
Finally we create the functions necessary for the behavior of the class.

For instantiations, we use "new" to create a new object of the class, and call the object's expected behavior function.
