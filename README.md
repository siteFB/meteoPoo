You will follow here my evolution on the PHP language of "object-oriented programming".<br>
First the notion of ‚Äúclass‚Äù then instantiation.<br>
Each class includes a list of specified properties of their "modifier" depending on the level of protection desired.<br>
In addition to properties, we list behaviors through methods: functions internal to the class.<br>
Next, a constructor.<br>
This is followed by encapsulation with accessors and setters: we use the "set" functions to program, and the "get" function to return.<br>
Finally we create the methods necessary for the behavior of the class.<br>
For instantiations, we use the "new" keyword to create a new object of the class. All that remains is to call the method of the expected behavior of the object.<br>

 . Ok, I have to reorganize ALL my code to prepare it well for factorization with functions... Laborious work because of many redirects... üí¶<br>
 . Same with query factorization! üí¶ üí¶ <br>
 . Next: models and class inherit
