Welcome to MeteoPoo! <br>
Here you will follow my evolution on the "Object-oriented PHP" language. <br>
First, the notion of "class" then instantiation. <br>
Each class includes a list of specified properties of their "modifier" depending on the level of protection desired. <br>
In addition to properties, we list behaviors through methods: functions internal to the class. <br>
Next, a constructor. <br>
This is followed by securing with accessors and mutators: we use the "set" functions to program, and the "get" function to return. <br>
Finally we create the functions necessary for the behavior of the class. <br>

For instantiations, we use "new" to create a new object of the class, and call the object's expected behavior function.
