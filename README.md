# Welcome to MeteoPoo! <br>
You will follow here my evolution on the PHP "object-oriented programming" language. <br>
First the notion of “class” then instantiation. <br>
Each class includes a list of specified properties of their "modifier" depending on the level of protection desired. <br>
In addition to properties, we list behaviors through methods: functions internal to the class. <br>
Next, a constructor. <br>
This is followed by encapsulation with accessors and setters: we use the "set" functions to program, and the "get" function to return. <br>
Finally we create the methods necessary for the behavior of the class. <br>

For instantiations, we use the "new" keyword to create a new object of the class. All that remains is to call the method of the expected behavior of the object.
