# Welcome to "M√©t√©o in POO"<br>
You will follow here my evolution on the PHP language of "object-oriented programming".
First the notion of ‚Äúclass‚Äù then instantiation.
Each class includes a list of specified properties of their "modifier" depending on the level of protection desired.
In addition to properties, we list behaviors through methods: functions internal to the class.
Next, a constructor.
This is followed by encapsulation with accessors and setters: we use the "set" functions to program, and the "get" function to return.
Finally we create the methods necessary for the behavior of the class.

For instantiations, we use the "new" keyword to create a new object of the class. All that remains is to call the method of the expected behavior of the object.

# NOW PRACTICE!
Ok, I have to reorganize ALL my code to prepare it well for factorization with functions... Laborious work because of many redirects... üí¶
Same with query factorization! üí¶ üí¶
